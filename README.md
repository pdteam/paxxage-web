# Paxxage.com Public Website

This repository is published to provide access to the code of the https://paxxage.com website. 

The goal is this site is to make simple cryptographic functions easy for the average user. All computations occur in the browser. Nothing is transmitted, and no data is stored. There are no cookies implemented. 

This repository is intended to build confidence in the tools and to provide a basis for other developers to provide similar tools and make crypto-based internet communications the global standard.

There is another repository in the works for the Paxxage Desktop app which is under construction. It is based within the Electron.js framework and uses Node.js functions to accelerate and enhance these processes.

This project is part of the Symaiotics platform.
